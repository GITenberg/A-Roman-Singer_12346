description: "A Roman Singer is an 1884 novel by F. Marion Crawford. First serialized\
  \ in The Atlantic from July 1883 to June 1884, it was published in book form in\
  \ 1884. It was among the best selling books in the United States in 1884.\nThe novel\
  \ is set in Rome. Crawford was born in Italy and spent a fair amount of time there,\
  \ including, most immediately before writing this novel, studying Sanskrit at the\
  \ University of Rome from 1876-78. He wrote A Roman Singer in early 1883, and moved\
  \ back to Italy that same year. The story revolves around the love of an Italian\
  \ tenor for the daughter of a Prussian officer.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
